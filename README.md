# Pong
This program is the Pong game recreated!

## Structure
- `ball.py` controls the ball behavior including movement and collision
- `paddle.py` has a paddle the user can control up and down to hit the ball as well as one the CPU control.
- `score.py` tracks the points and displays them on the screen.
- `main.py` ties together all classes and behaves as the nucleus
## Dependencies & Configurations
1. The program utilizes [turtle graphics](https://docs.python.org/3/library/turtle.html) for all the graphical displays.
